# Project 1: Search
---
Berkeley CS188 Intro to AI in this [link](http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html)  

In this project, mine Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. I builded general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.

As in Project 0, this project includes an autograder for you to grade your answers on your machine. This can be run with the command:


## Edited files
I filled portions of ```search.py``` and ```searchAgents.py``` during the assignment. 


## Evaluation
Code was autograded for technical correctness. Running this cmd:

```
python autograder.py
```
