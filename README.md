# Berkeley_PacMan

I tried to make the course of Berkeley in Artificial Intelligence. This projects made as part of the lesson Artificial Intelligence 1, taught by Dr. Manolis Koubarakis in 2019-2020 winter semester.

This repository consists of the Berkeley projects:

- __Project 0__: Simple intro to basic python code 
- __Project 1__:  Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, A* Search, Representation and Heuristic improvements. These are the algorithms that I've tried to implement and experiment.
- __Project 2__: Reflex Agent, Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Expectimax, Evaluation Function
